What is geohashing?

The earth can be split up into a bunch of rectangles, 8 wide and 4 tall. These rectangles are numbered
1 - 9 and A - Z (or some letter).

If we zoom in on any of the rectangles, we can see that each of these rectangles is 8 wide and 4 tall as
well.  These rectangles are numbered in the same scheme.

9 characters is 4.7 meters squared.

Geohash defined by 4 corners that surround it.


"I knew this before. I was studying how to design Yelp (ProximityServer) and Geo-hashing seemed like a good tool for that.
Instead of using longitude and latitude, geo-hash will give you a string.
 The longer the string, the more zoom-in we are. To display average temperatures 
 for a region, we have to take all the geo-hashes that starts with a certain 
 set of characters and average the out."

 "Geohashes offer properties like arbitrary precision and the possibility 
 of gradually removing characters from the end of the code to reduce its size
  (and gradually lose precision). As a consequence of the gradual precision
   degradation, nearby places will often (but not always) present similar
    prefixes. The longer a shared prefix is, the closer the two places are."
